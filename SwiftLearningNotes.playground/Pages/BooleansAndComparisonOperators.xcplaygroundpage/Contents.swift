var greeting = "Hello, playground"
// var keyword means variable and it is used when the value can be changed.

let message = "goodbye"
// let means the value is a constant and cannot be changed.

//Only printed message is seen on terminal

//------- BOOLEANS -------

//let no: Bool = false
//let yes: Bool = true
//Theese two are an example of setting boolean values.

//But instead of using Bool keyword we can directly set a boolean value like this

let no = false
let yes = true

let passingGrade = 60
let studentGrade = 70

//------- COMPARİSON OPERATORS -------

let passed = studentGrade >= passingGrade
// >= means if the left value is greater or equal than the right value the statement becomes true but if its wrong then the passed value becomes false.

let failed = studentGrade < passingGrade
// < means if the left value is lesser than the right value the statement becomes true but if its wrong then the passed value becomes false.

let ChrisGrade = 55
let SamGrade = 97

ChrisGrade == SamGrade

// = is used for assigning
// == is used for looking if both of them are equal

ChrisGrade != SamGrade
// != means is not equal.

let catName = "Bella"
let dogName = "Chav"

catName == dogName

catName < dogName

//in this scenario catName comes before the dogName in the alphabet, that is why it is less greater
